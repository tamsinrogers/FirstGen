    Keep in mind:
    <br>
    While we can’t speak on behalf of the experience of everyone, it is true in many places that this country remains very xenophobic.   and how people treat you as well as job opportunities may still be negative experiences, especially if you are a person of color. And don't be surprised if your children’s children are still call immigrants, remember, we built this nation.
    Assimilation is difficult and sometimes a very sad experience it’s a personal choice to maintain ties with your home country and and still come to terms with why you left. This is a long process and everyone deals with it differently, but the one thing we can share is you are not alone. The journey and challenges you have overcome are incredible, even if you don't always feel valued or welcome, you are not alone. Immigrants will always make this country great.
