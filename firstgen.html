    <br><h3><i><center>As first-generation United States citizens, we understanding that bridging the gap between the culture of your family’s native country <br> and the United States can be difficult.  Here, we have compiled a series of tips directed towards children of immigrants <br> as they assist their families in adjusting to a new life in the states and striking a delicate balance between two different worlds</center></i></h3>
  <table bgcolor="FFD1DC">
  <tr>
    <td><center><h1><font size=8>Socialization</font></h1></center><p>&rarr; Promote the importance of social connections with friends and colleagues.  Adjusting to American society can be made easier if your family has reliable resources, such as fellow immigrants or multilingual friends.</p></td>

    <td><center><h1><font size=8>Combination of Cultures</font></h1></center><p>&rarr; Express both your appreciation for preserving your family's culture and an eagerness to learn more about social and cultural aspects in the United States.</p>
<p>&rarr; While it is important for your family to continue to recognize their native culture, stress the importance that one’s association with American practices at home can be helpful regarding a cultural transition.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  
    <td><center><h1><font size=8>Language</font></h1></center><p>&rarr; Many immigrants find that they are able to adjust to a new culture while successfully preserving their native one by speaking/learning English, but continuing to use their native language at home.</p>
<p>&rarr; If you are not confident in your speaking abilities, let someone know.  Most public schools in the United States offer English Language Learner (ELL) programs, which will ensure that a language barrier does not stand in the way of your academic progress.</p>
<p>&rarr; If your parent’s ability to speak English is weak, suggest taking free or low-cost English classes.  Translators are often available to assist your family members in communicating with your school teachers.  Additionally, suggest listening to the radio, watching American television, or reading the newspaper.  All of these thing can help familiarize a foreigner with the English language, ultimately making communication with society in the United States easier. </p>
<p>&rarr; As a child attending school, it may appeal to you to speak only English at home, as you do in school.  Keep in mind that preserving your family’s culture is important, and as much as your parents may be eager for you to adjust to American culture, part of them will always want you to stay close to your roots.</p>
<p>&rarr; Find a happy medium!  Being a multicultural student has its advantages - as you become familiarized with the English language in school, share your knowledge with your family.  Meanwhile, they can help develop your understanding of your family’s native language.</p></td>

    <td><center><h1><font size=8>Things to Expect</font></h1></center><p>&rarr; It is common for immigrant parents to expect their children to translate for them if they do not speak English.  This may feel embarrassing or mentally taxing at times, but in the end you’ll turn into a multilingual badass.</p>
<p>&rarr; You may notice differences in the way the food you eat at home and at school looks.  Remember that bringing a lunch from home is okay, even if you’re the only one with food looks different. Just know a lot of people pay good money at fancy restaurants for the same food they said “ew!” to when they were little. </p>
<p>&rarr; More often than not, you yourself won’t be seen as American even though you were born here. You’ll probably be considered an immigrant yourself even though the biggest migration you might have made was being born in your local hospital. Be prepared for the frequent question: “But where are you really from?” </p>
<p>&rarr; The bar for grades and success can be set pretty high.  While this may seem like a lot of pressure, remember that this often comes from your parents wanting a better life for you in the United States than the one they may have had, and want to ensure that you are taking full advantage of the opportunities this country has to offer. </p>
<p>&rarr; Going back to visit your parents' home countries can be a loaded experience. Many of us feel alone because we’re all of a sudden seen as the “American” while back home no one may see you as American. The best thing to do here is learn about your parent’s culture and connect with your family. Forget labels and what people call you and just do you.</p>
