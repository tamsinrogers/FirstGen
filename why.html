  <h2><center>Right now, it feels our country is going backwards. Suddenly, xenophobia and racism have stepped into the limelight. It's our duty to stand together and help one another to create a more equitable and diverse United States. We could sit here and write essays worth of points on why we should act now, but honestly all change has to start with you. Organize your friends, contribute in your community, call your representatives, start small, you never know who's life you will change. <br> <br/>
    “I had always hoped that this land might become a safe and agreeable asylum to the virtuous and persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong.”  - George Washington</center></center></h2>

That doesn't mean we should tolerate it. White terrorism is still terrorism. Help out and sign, let's show the department of justice what the american people stand for. The KKK and it's many factions are domestic terrorist and we will not stand for them not being prosecuted as such..</p></td>

  <td><p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/immigrant-children-deserve-legal-counsel"><center><h1><font face = "Raleway" size=8>Unacompannied Immigrant Minors</font></h1></center></a>&rarr; This petition is extremely important, the fact of the matter is that currently, unaccompanied minors are not guaranteed any sort of legal representation when seeking refuge in the U.S. To us, that is preposterous, no child here alone should have to represent themselves in court, alone. Please please sign and make a difference!</p>
