        <p>&rarr; The most essential thing is to form friendships and connections with other <br>immigrants in the United States.  Even if they are not from your home country, <br>you are going through the same experience together, and it is <br>important to have friends who share this with you.
        <p>&rarr; Differences in greetings and sayings
        <p>&rarr; As a child immigrant, it is typical for one to feel as though they do not <br>have control over what is happening.  This is because minors are not <br>the ones applying for citizenship, but they are still subject <br>to the hardships that many other foreigners face.
        <p>&rarr; It is still common for new citizens to feel and be treated like outsiders, <br>regardless of the fact that they now hold a US citizenship.
        <p>&rarr; The journey and challenges you have overcome are incredible, <br>even if you do not always feel valued or welcome, you are not alone.  <br>Immigrants will always make this country great.
